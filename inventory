# By default, beaker_server is local.
# If you use an external Beaker service (not along the dci-rhel-agent),
# please configure the Ansible connexion NOT to be local.
#
# As dci-rhel-agent use a container, please ensure ssh key is located
# at `/etc/dci-rhel-agent/secrets/id_rsa` if needed.
# ie:
# beaker_server ansible_host=10.150.70.1 ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/dci-rhel-agent/secrets/id_rsa

# The [beaker_sut] is empty. Do not touch.
